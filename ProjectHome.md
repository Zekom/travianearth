Travian Earth, is small Java application for [Travian](http://www.travian.com) on-line game. The idea of this application is taken from [here.](http://help.travian.com/index.php?type=faq&mod=230)

I wrote this application as an exercise to learn how to program in Java.

Test to run the application using Java Web Start [run the application on-line from here](http://www.myjavaserver.com/~travianearth/travian.jnlp).
Test to run the application as an applet [here](http://www.myjavaserver.com/~travianearth/travian.html).

This application shows your Travian world in a simple map. Download the map from your server and unzip it to "map.sql" file. For example:
  * http://www.travian.org/karte.sql
  * http://welt1.travian.de/karte.sql.gz
  * http://s1.travian.com/map.sql.gz
  * http://speed.travian.nl/map.sql.gz

It is easy and straightforward. [Check this youtube link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BHmu6doavg).

Brief instructions

  * Use the mouse left button to lock/unlock the village information in the info panel to the left.
  * Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out the map.
  * Use the pop-up menu to colour villages and alliances.
